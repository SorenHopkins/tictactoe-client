## Planning
I planned out a sketch of an application very similar to my current application.
The plan was to seperate the log-in landing page from the main screen with the
tic-tac-toe board, which was relatively easy (after I overheard someone
talking about using Hide classes for that. Hooray!). The board was implemented
on a multilevel approach, simulating it in board state, in store, and in the actual
object being patched. A little overcomplicated, maybe, but it worked. I did change
many aesthetic elements from the original plan, and I decided against some of the
stretch goals that I'd thought about tackling in favor of trying to clean up errors
and getting it to look nice.

## Unsolved Issues
I'm not currently aware of any unresolved issues. Any issues brought up to me
during the process of building the game were addressed. I'd love to come back to this
to build an AI, however- that could be a fun little challenge, and make it a bit
more impressive.
